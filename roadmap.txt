Phase 1 - Local only no registry
1. Package format, create a gpm.json file.

2. Install Logic

    CLI tool reads gpm.json

    Copies each dependency folder into gpm_modules/

    Optionally flatten or preserve tree structure

3. Command: gpm install

    Parse JSON

    Copy dependencies into local folder

    Save a lock file gpm-lock.json (for later)

Phase 2: Simple Package Format + CLI Publish/Install

Goal: Simulate a "publish" and "install from remote" flow.

    1. Basic Registry (Local or Cloud)

        Use a folder or a basic server to store .tgz files of packages

    2. CLI Commands

        gpm publish: Zips current package folder and pushes to "registry"

        gpm install package-name: Downloads + unpacks to gpm_modules/

    3. Versioning

        Include "version": "1.0.0" in gpm.json

        Store versions like registry/leftpad/1.0.0.tgz

Phase 3: Dependency Resolution + Semantic Versioning

Goal: Add support for versions and resolution

    Implement semver range resolution (e.g. ^1.2.0)

    Build a dependency tree and resolve conflicts (at least basic version of it)

    Lock file includes resolved versions

    Handle nested dependencies

Phase 4 (Optional): Caching, Scripts, Auth, etc.

    Package cache to avoid re-downloading

    Post-install scripts

    Private registries / authentication

    Real registry backend (use something like S3 or your own server)


SEMVER RANGES
Semantic Versioning
pattern -> MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
- 1.2.3: 
    Major Version = 1, Minor = 2, Patch = 3


| Range    | Meaning                               |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `1.2.3`  | Exact version                         |
| `^1.2.3` | Compatible upgrades: `>=1.2.3 <2.0.0` |
| `~1.2.3` | Patch upgrades only: `>=1.2.3 <1.3.0` |
| `*`      | Any version                           |
| `latest` | The highest available version         |
